# Oil_time_series
Model for oil volume transporting forecasting

In this project, I tested the ability of deep learning models to predict a parameter in the short term (1 year).
For training, a dataset (684 months) was used, which was divided into training (70%), validation (20%) and test (10%).
As a result, I became convinced that networks based on layers of tf.keras.LSTM are able to well generalize data and predict.
